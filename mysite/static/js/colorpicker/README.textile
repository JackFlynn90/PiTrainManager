h1. jQuery ColorPicker

I needed a color picker and couldn't find one I liked so I made one.

Please fork, update, then let me know :)

h2. usage
# load jQuery
# load jQuery ColorPicker
# instantiate jQuery ColorPicker

h2. jQuery.ColorPicker

bc. var myPicker = new jQuery.ColorPicker('#myDiv', {
  imagepath: '../images/'
});

h3. constructor

bc. jQuery.ColorPicker(container [, options])

* @container@ : String
  jQuery selector string for the element to be occupied by the ColorPicker.
* @options@ : Object
  Dictionary style object. See available options below.

h4. options

* @imagepath@ : String
  The relative path from the page instantiating jQuery ColorPicker to the folder containing the included image files. Defaults to "" (same directory)
* @change@ : Function
  the given function will be called every time the ColorPicker updates. Keep in mind this may be many times a second while the user is dragging.

h3. methods

* @change()@
  Calls the change function supplied in options.
  ex. @myPicker.change();@
* @hex()@
  Returns current hexadecimal color.
  ex. @var myHexColor = myPicker.hex();@
* @hex(hexString)@
  Sets ColorPicker to specified hexadecimal color.
  ex. @myPicker.hex('#ffffff');@

h2. compatibility
* Tested only in Firefox 3.6, Chrome 4.0, and Safari 4.0.4 only since this is for an internal site.
* Firefox is a bit buggy with dragging.
